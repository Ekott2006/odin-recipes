        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
          <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
          <li>1 cup milk</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
          <li>2 ripe bananas, mashed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) in
            one bowl and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed
            bananas) in another bowl.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients, then
            stir until they're incorporated. It's OK if your batter is slightly
            lumpy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour the batter in ¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan or
            griddle over medium-high heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook for a few minutes, flip with a spatula, and cook for another
            few minutes (or until each side is golden brown).
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve your banana pancakes immediately. They're delicious alone or
            with your favorite pancake toppings.
